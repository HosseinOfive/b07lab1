In this lab we will be making a polynomial class!




we have two constructor one of them needs a array of double as the coeficeint in reverse order 
i.e x^2 + 5x + 6 ~~ [6, 5, 1]


an add method whcih adds to poly's 

and an evaluate and a hasRoot method which evaluates value of poly at the given double "point" and the other checks whether the given double "point" is a root of the poly
